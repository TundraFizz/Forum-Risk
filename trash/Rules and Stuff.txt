===== Setup =====
Each player picks the following:
1. Color
2. Faction Name
3. Two adjacent states to own
 - You may not begin the game with an adjacent state to another player

===== Play =====
Each turn you must do two things:
1. [roll]
2. Choose one action:
 - Expand
 - Attack
 - Fortify

6-9:   Claim 2 states
Dubs:  Claim 3 states
Trips: Claim 5 states

===== Fortify =====

Trips: All of your states are now fortified

===== Conflict =====
If there are any conflicts between players, the winner is determined by following:
 - Trips
 - Dubs

===== 1000 =====
If you roll 1000, you have found a nuke and can instantly destroy any faction you want.
Make a second post on this turn (without a roll) saying who you will destroy.
This is the only instance in which having two posts in one turn is permitted.
You may still take your standard action as if you rolled trips.

New players may join in at any time.
 - They immediately claim an amount of states equal to the average states owned by all other players (rounded down)
 - They are not subject to the rule where they can't begin in states adjacent to other players
 - All of their states must be adjacent to each other
 - They may begin with a reduced amount of states
